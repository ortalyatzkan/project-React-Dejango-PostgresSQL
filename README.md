Summary of work on the project-Ortal Yatzkan
 When I started the exercise I had a basic knowledge of react and python.
During the exercise I first programmed in django and the first time I used the postgresql database.
I will detail how I did the exercise and what materials I used:
First step:
I searched youtube for videos about django and postgresql.
I watched the video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pwwz4_AvHDU
You have to follow step by step to create the project and download the relevant software.
Second step:
I used the following article to create a database and to understand how it works:
https://stackpython.medium.com/how-to-start-django-project-with-a-database-postgresql-aaa1d74659d8.
Third step:
Now that I have created the project and connected to the database and understood how to use the database, I started working on the client side, for this I used the previous knowledge I have in react, java script , HTML and css.
In case there is no prior knowledge on these topics you can start by reading the site:
https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics
https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html
https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html
Fourth stage:
Now that I have finished building the page structure of the client side by using react, html and java script I started trying to send requests from client side to server, for this purpose I first ran the client side and the network side by using the following commands:
Client side: npm start
Server side: python manage.py runserver
To understand how to write client-side requests to the server and reverse I used the sites:
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-useeffect-absolute-beginners/
https://www.django-rest-framework.org/
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref 
Fifth step:
Now that I have been able to transfer data from client to server and server to client, I have started learning how to store data on the server.
Examples that can help (Django code):

Step Six:
In order to search the database I used the following explanations:
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/db/search/
Step Seven:
To export the data to an excel file I used the article:
https://simpleisbetterthancomplex.com/tutorial/2016/07/29/how-to-export-to-excel.html
Installations:
Visual studio code - source-code editor:
https://code.visualstudio.com   /
PG-Admin Database management:
https://www.pgadmin.org
Download PostgreSQL

Visual studio installations:
The directory for client API requests-
npm i axios in
npm install react-router-dom â€“save
There are other installations that appear in the videos and articles I mentioned.
While working on the project, I used other videos on YouTube and sites like Stackoverflow to find solutions to problems I encountered.
